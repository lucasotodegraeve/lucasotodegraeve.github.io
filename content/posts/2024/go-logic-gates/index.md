Here's a little project I put together. It's a small logic gate simulator built with [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

## Logic Simulation

If you want to see a more flushed-out version of this idea, I highly recommend [Sebastian League's video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq&si=xtOuDfWtn7T6USgG). In my version, you start by building a small logic network using the provided gates.

  <source src="builder.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

You can move the gates around and create links between them by click-and-dragging from a gate's output socket. Gates can be removed by right-clicking on them. Switches are the inputs of the network and can be toggled later on.

Pressing enter brings you from the building screen to the simulation screen.

Here you see the input and output values of every gate. By pressing the step button, you can advance the simulation by 1 tick. Every tick the outputs of the gates are evaluated before being propagated to other gates.  

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/lucasotodegraeve/go-logic-gates).

## Raylib with Nix
I'm still a bit of a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) noobie so I struggled quite a bit to get Raylib working. I eventually got [these Raylib bindings](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) to work by putting the following `buildInputs` in a `mkShell`.
```nix
buildInputs = with pkgs; [
  libGL
  xorg.libXi
  wayland
  libxkbcommon
  xorg.libX11
  xorg.libXcursor
  xorg.libXrandr
  xorg.libXinerama
];
```
I wasn't brave enough to try and build the Go module the Nix way (mainly because `go mod vendor` doesn't pull all the required files from github). Calling `go build` did the job just fine.

The following was also needed once I moved the main package into a subdirectory:
```
hardeningDisable = [ "all" ];
```
